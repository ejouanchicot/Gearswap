# Commands

Every command is typed as `//gs c <command> [arguments]`, from the chat line,
a macro (`/console gs c <command>`) or a key. This page lists the commands
every job shares. Each job's own commands are on its page:
[jobs](../jobs/README.md).

`//gs c help` prints the built-in help and `//gs c commands` the built-in list
(it does not show `tb`, `trace` and `sortie`).

When two commands share a name, the order is: warp shortcuts and the commands
below, then the job's commands, then Mote-Include's (`cycle`, `set`,
`toggle`, `update`...), and last the dual-box alt commands.

## HUD

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ui` | Show / hide the keybind HUD |
| `ui on` / `ui off` | Show / hide |
| `ui save` (`ui s`) | Save the position (dragging alone is not saved) |
| `ui header` / `legend` / `columns` / `footer` (`h` `l` `c` `f`) | Show / hide that part |
| `ui font <name>` | Font, e.g. `Consolas` |
| `ui theme <preset>` / `ui theme list` / `ui theme toggle` / `ui theme <r> <g> <b> <a>` | Background (`bg` and `background` work too) |
| `ui help` | These options |

## Modes

| Command | Effect |

| `cyclestate <Mode>` | Next value of a mode (what the keys send) |
| `cyclestate <Mode> reverse` | Previous value |
| `cycle <Mode>` / `cycleback <Mode>` | Same, through Mote-Include (prints a chat line) |
| `set <Mode> <Value>` / `toggle <Mode>` / `reset <Mode>` | Mote-Include |
| `am` (`automedicine`) `[on/off]` | Auto Medicine: Echo Drops / Remedy / Panacea used when a debuff blocks your action |

## Gear and inventory

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `checksets` | Lists set items you do not have in inventory or wardrobes (`STORAGE` = in another bag, `MISSING` = nowhere) |
| `wa` (`wardrobeaudit`) | Wardrobe items no set file uses; report written to `data/wardrobe_audit.txt` |
| `wo` (`worganize`) | Wardrobe organizer: moves the gear you use into the first wardrobes, the rest into overflow bags |
| `wo preview` | What it would move, without moving |
| `wo scan` / `wo keep` | Record the warp items you own / list the items kept in the main bags beyond those your sets name |
| `wo alt` | Variant for a character with 4 wardrobes: every job's sets count, overflow goes to Sack / Case / Satchel |
| `wo recover` | Release the slots if a run was interrupted |
| `rf` (`refill`) | Restock consumables from the Mog Case and Mog Sack, put the surplus back; also sent to your other boxes |
| `naked` (or `equip naked`) | Remove every piece |
| `reload` | Reload the job file |
| `ls` (`lockstyle`) | Apply the lockstyle again; also sent to your other boxes |
| `dressup` | Stop / resume unloading DressUp around the lockstyle (kept for next time) |
| `craft [variant]`, `craft off` | Crafting set from `sets/bonecraft_sets.lua` (only the Tetsouo template has one) |
| `fish` (`fishing`) | Fishing set from `sets/fishing_sets.lua` (same) |
| `uncraft` | Leave the craft / fishing set |

`wo` details: it unequips everything and locks your slots while it runs,
then releases them and sends `ls` and `rf`. Its words are lowercase only: an
unknown word (even `Preview`) runs a full organize. The bags it uses come from
`config/WARDROBE_CONFIG.lua` if you have one; otherwise wardrobes 1-2 are the
main bags and 3-6 and 8 the overflow (wardrobe 7 is never touched).
